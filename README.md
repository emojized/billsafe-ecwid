# billsafe-ecwid

This is more or less a test. We once had the issue that we need Billsafe from PayPal into Ecwid.com stores.
To solve this we created kinda payment gateway.

unluckily the project is dead and we thought to make it open source to provide it for other developers.

The development fails because of the lack to modify Ecwid Invoices in the time it has been written.
Maybe Ecwid was going further
